            <p>I got into programming when I was in highschool and took a Web Design class that taught me a lot of the basics of HTML. CSS was only introduced in the last few weeks of class. I wanted to further learn web design and little did I know it is a world of unlimited possibilities and I do not think I will ever stop learning new things I can accomplish. I was also very into game design, I was never super creative but when I got the ideas flowing when I was talking about games I wanted to play I could talk with friends for hours about what I would create.</p><br />
        <p>It was during my Senior year of highschool that I decided to apply to schools for Game Development degrees wherever I could find it offered. I ended up going to the Univeristy of Central Missouri, a school in Warrensburg, Missouri. I started as an undergrad with a Major of Computer Science: Game Development Option but after my first year learning Java and Python and some intro into web applications I was very intrigued and I wanted to learn more of that back end development and what the heck a scrum team or agile development was. So, I switched my major to Software Engineering which was a fairly new program at the time.</p><br />
        <p>During my classes I learned how to build and analyze algorithms, time complexity, recursion, and lots more. I upgraded my knowledge of programming languages from 3-4 to around 13-15 with varying experience. I worked on a bunch of projects and even kept to my original passion of wanting to make some video games and took some game development classes for electives as well which allowed me to pick up C++ and C# and add them to my arsenal. Now I am here just a few months away from graduation and I am genuinely excited to learn even more and work on many projects and with many teams. Enough about me, the next section will cover some of the projects/games that I have worked on throughout my 4 years.</p>

        <h1>My Projects</h1>
            <div class="contentText"><p>There are a great many projects that I have had the opportunity ot work on alone and with a team that I cannot cover all of them here but I can cover some of the projects where I learned some very valuable skills.</p><br />
        <p><b>Covid-19 Tracking Application</b> - This is the project that I believe is the closest to real world industry work that I can say I have worked on. For this project I worked on a team of four people and our client was Commerce Bank. This took place during the height of the initial wave of the pandemic so we worked mostly remote and over Zoom, Discord, Microsoft Teams, or through E-Mail. Commerce Bank had asked us to develop a web application that would help track positive cases within the office.</p><br />
